        My Self Faisal Moin. I am currently studying Computer Science And
        Engeneering in Brac university. I was always curious about problem
        sovling and how the machine works, but last year i came accross this Web
        dev course, i picked it out because i thought it might be
        interesting.And i was shocked how quickly i fell in love with web
        development. My wish or goal is to master font end by the end of the
        year. Thank you.
